//! Aegis runtime.
//!
//! The WebView renders UI only. The agent loop, tool execution, secrets and
//! policy all live here (AGENTS.md). Phase 1 wired logging, managed state, the
//! IPC command surface, the tray and the window lifecycle; Phase 2 adds the
//! project store. Later phases add commands and modules without changing this
//! entry shape.
